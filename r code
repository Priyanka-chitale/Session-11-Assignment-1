## b. Show a distribution of clients based on a Job.

job = table(bank$job)
barplot(job, main="Distribution on clients", 
        xlab="Clients", ylab = "Count")

## c. Check whether is there any relation between Job and Marital Status?

chisq.test(bank$marital,bank$job)

## We reject the null hypothesis as the p value is very low. There is a relation between Job and Marital Status

## d. Check whether is there any association between Job and Education?

chisq.test(bank$job, bank$education)

## We reject the null hypothesis as the p value is very low. There is an association between Job and Education
